using git
version control 


scrum during team project: 



all properties and tracks are kept in .git hidden folder
*git status: changed file or line
*ls -la    = hidden files included

track- shows all changes of a file then need to commit
commit- when we create a version. 
red color- not tracked or remove from git

To add in track:

*git add filename

short cut command: 
*git add.
all untracked file adds.
staging means adding or tracking 
unstage means removing/ untrack



*git commit -am "Initial commit"  = we can add message in git commit 

adding we are bringing everything in a platform.
with commit we will approve it as a part of the project



1. git init
2. git add filename or all
3. commit

after changing again we have to add and commit

*git log  = show all commit lists

*git checkout 55d29937  (1st 6 ids)
to go to the previous commits


the text file will be uploaded to the previous commit. Will show only to the log.
but we can git checkout and go to previous version
